# Lambda


1. Purpose of the Execution Role on the Lambda Function:
The execution role in AWS Lambda is an IAM role that grants the Lambda function the necessary permissions to access AWS resources when it is executed. This role defines what the Lambda function can and cannot do during its execution.
For example, if your Lambda function needs to read files from an S3 bucket when triggered, the execution role must include the s3:GetObject permission for the relevant S3 bucket. The execution role is specified when the Lambda function is created, and it's assumed by the function when it is triggered. This role essentially defines the permissions of the Lambda function itself.
2. Purpose of the Resource-Based Policy on the Lambda Function:
A resource-based policy in AWS Lambda is an access control policy attached directly to the Lambda function. This policy defines which AWS services or accounts can invoke or access the Lambda function.
For example, if an S3 bucket triggers your Lambda function upon file creation, a resource-based policy allows the S3 bucket to invoke the Lambda function. This is important for cross-service permissions because the Lambda function might need to accept invocations from a specific AWS service (like S3) or other AWS accounts.
Essentially, a resource-based policy grants other AWS services or accounts permissions to invoke the Lambda function.
3. Lambda Function Needs to Upload a File into an S3 Bucket:
To allow the Lambda function to upload a file into an S3 bucket, you'll need to make updates to the execution role and potentially the resource-based policy.
Update on the Execution Role:
You would need to add the necessary permissions to the execution role to allow the Lambda function to upload files into the S3 bucket. Specifically, the execution role would need the following permissions:
•	s3:PutObject – This allows the Lambda function to upload files to the S3 bucket.
•	s3:PutObjectAcl – If the Lambda function needs to set permissions on the uploaded objects (for example, setting access control lists), this permission would be necessary.
The policy would look something like this:
json
Copy
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
Update on the Resource-Based Policy:
In general, the resource-based policy for the Lambda function does not need to change if the Lambda function is only uploading files to an S3 bucket. However, if the Lambda function needs to invoke other AWS services (like S3) as part of the file upload process, then the service invoking Lambda (S3 in this case) needs the appropriate permissions to invoke the Lambda function.
If the question is about how S3 invokes the Lambda function upon file creation, ensure that the Lambda resource-based policy allows S3 to trigger the function. But for the purpose of uploading to S3, no update to the Lambda function's resource-based policy is required unless another service, such as another Lambda function, needs permission to invoke this Lambda function.
________________________________________
Summary :
•	Execution Role Update: Add s3:PutObject (and optionally s3:PutObjectAcl) permissions to the Lambda execution role to allow it to upload files to the S3 bucket.
•	Resource-Based Policy Update: No change is needed unless there are additional cross-service invocation needs (like if another service needs to invoke the Lambda function).
